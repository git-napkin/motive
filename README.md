## What makes it different

> **Other AI tools hold your attention hostage.**  
> Cursor locks you in a window. Claude Code blocks your terminal. Switch away, and you miss the prompt.
>
> **Motive lets you walk away.** AI works in the background. When it needs you, a popup drops from your menu bar. One click, done, back to your flow.

<br />

### 🎯 Background-first
AI runs as a background process — like compiling or rendering. Submit a task, go back to your work. No window to watch.

### 📍 Menu bar native  
Lives in your menu bar, always one click away. Permission requests drop down as popups. Never miss a prompt, never switch apps.

### 🔐 Local & private
All data stays on your machine. Bring your own API keys. Run fully offline with Ollama.

### ⚡ Native macOS
Built with SwiftUI & AppKit. No Electron, no web views. Fast, lightweight, and feels like part of the OS.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from Cursor / Claude Desktop?</strong></summary>

They lock you in a window. Motive lives in your menu bar. You submit a task, walk away, and the AI finds you when it needs input.

Think of it this way: desktop apps are like a colleague who insists you sit in their office. Motive is like a colleague who handles everything autonomously and only taps your shoulder when necessary.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is my data sent anywhere?</strong></summary>

Motive is local-first. Sessions and history stay on your machine. The only network traffic is API requests to your chosen AI provider. Use Ollama for 100% offline operation.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why does it need Accessibility permission?</strong></summary>

To register the global hotkey (`⌥Space`) that summons the command bar from anywhere on your Mac.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use local models?</strong></summary>

Yes. Select Ollama as your provider and point it to your local instance. Zero cloud dependency.
